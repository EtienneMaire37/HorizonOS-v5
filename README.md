HorizonOS is a hobby 32-bit monolithic kernel for the x86 architecture. It aims at simplicity and readability.

## Features

HorizonOS currently supports the following features:

* **Features:**
    * Single-core multitasking with basic round robin scheduling
    * Memory management limited to 4GB
    * Basic POSIX-like C library implementation
    * Extremely basic ACPI parsing 
    * GRUB bootloader integration
    * PS/2 keyboard driver (8042)
    * Legacy (8259) PIC support
* **Planned:**
    * More than 4GB memory with PAE
    * Full APIC and ACPI support 
    * Multicore support with SMP
    * Custom VFS
    * Better scheduler
    * ATA and USB drivers
    * Network stack support and Ethernet drivers

## Building HorizonOS

These instructions assume a Debian-like environment. Feel free to adapt those instructions to other platforms.

### Prerequisites

Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential bison flex libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev texinfo
sudo apt install nasm xorriso mtools
```

### Building

Simply run: 
```bash
make all CLOGLEVEL=-DLOGLEVEL=TRACE
```
To have e9 port logs. Or:
```bash
make all
```
To build without logs.
A `horizonos.iso` disk image file will be created in the root of the repository.

### Running HorizonOS

To run HorizonOS in QEMU:
```bash
make run
```
