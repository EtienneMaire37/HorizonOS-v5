A 32-bit monolithic kernel for the x86 architecture

## Overview üåü
HorizonOS is a hobby kernel targeting x86 systems, designed as a learning platform for low-level systems programming. Built from scratch and using the GRUB bootloader, it demonstrates core operating system concepts while maintaining simplicity and readability.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

### Implemented ‚úÖ
- Monolithic kernel design for single-processor systems
- Basic memory management (paging, frame allocation) supporting up to 4GB RAM
- Preemptive multitasking implementation
- Minimal ACPI parsing capabilities
- PS/2 keyboard driver
- Custom C library (libc) in development
- Basic math library (libm)

### Planned üìÖ
- Multi-core support
- PCI device enumeration
- USB drivers and mouse support
- Network stack support and ethernet drivers
- Graphical display support
- Improved filesystem support

## Building HorizonOS üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites üì¶
- i386-elf cross-compiler
- NASM assembler
- GRUB 2.0+
- QEMU (for emulation)

### Install build dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu) üêß
```bash
sudo apt install nasm grub-pc-bin qemu-system-i386
```

### Set up cross-compiler (using included script) ‚öôÔ∏è
```bash
sudo sh install-cross-compiler.sh
```

### Compilation üî®
```bash
make all
```

### Running in QEMU üöÄ
```bash
make run
```

The horizonos.iso file will be generated in the repository's root.

This will:
1. Build the kernel ISO
2. Launch QEMU with:
   - 256MB RAM
   - CD-ROM boot
   - Serial output
   - VGA display
   - Logging to debug/ directory
